# Phase 2 Completion — Headless Core Prototype

Date: 2026-05-31

---

## Phase 2 Summary

Phase 2 built the smallest functional headless core prototype that proves Feather can launch, control, inspect, measure, and close isolated Chromium sessions through a Feather-owned local HTTP API. The implementation delivers a full Node/TypeScript service backed by Playwright, Fastify, Zod, JSONL structured logging, profile lock enforcement, debug bundles, and resource measurement — with no GUI, no Chrome extensions, and no real `yt-dlp` execution. All nine Phase 2 exit criteria are satisfied.

## What Was Built

- **Node/TypeScript service** (`src/index.ts`) — starts Fastify, writes `.feather/run/endpoint.json` and `.feather/run/control-token`, then listens on a configured or random free port.
- **Configuration layer** (`src/config.ts`) — reads `FEATHER_PORT`, `FEATHER_DIR`, and other env vars; provides typed defaults.
- **Filesystem layout** (`src/fs-layout.ts`) — single `FeatherPaths` helper that resolves every `.feather/` path consistently: profiles, tmp sessions, debug, logs, measurements, run.
- **Session types and credential redaction** (`src/sessions/`) — shared `SessionRecord` type, `redactProxy()` helper that strips `username`/`password` from all API responses and logs.
- **Browser mode builder** (`src/browser/modes.ts`) — `buildLaunchOptions()` for both `chromium-new-headless` (channel `chromium`, `headless: true`) and `chromium-headless-shell` (default Playwright shell path).
- **Profile locking** (`src/profiles/lock.ts`) — atomic lock file create/release, `PROFILE_LOCKED` error on concurrent launch, metadata written to lock (sessionId, PID, timestamps, browserMode, sanitized proxy).
- **Workspace metadata** (`src/profiles/workspace.ts`) — `workspace.json` read/write for persistent profile directories.
- **JSONL logger** (`src/logs/logger.ts`) — `FeatherLogger` writes structured JSONL events per session to `.feather/logs/sessions/<id>.jsonl`; all 15 minimum events defined in `EVENTS` map.
- **Session lifecycle** (`src/sessions/manager.ts`, `src/sessions/session.ts`) — `SessionManager` owns in-process session registry; `FeatherSession` wraps a Playwright persistent browser context for both persistent and disposable profiles; disposable profiles are deleted on close; quarantine path available on forced close.
- **Debug capture** (`src/debug/capture.ts`) — attaches Playwright listeners at session launch to collect network requests, console messages, and errors into per-session JSONL files.
- **Debug bundle** (`src/debug/bundle.ts`) — `DebugBundle` writes `manifest.json` (sessionId, workspaceId, times, Playwright version, browser path, artifact list), `commands.jsonl`, `network-summary.jsonl`, `console.jsonl`, `errors.jsonl`, and organises `screenshots/` directory.
- **Nine command handlers** (`src/commands/`) — `launch`, `status`, `navigate`, `snapshot`, `extract`, `screenshot`, `debug-bundle`, `close`; all implement a common `CommandHandler` base; all emit JSONL events before and after execution.
- **HTTP transport** (`src/transport/routes.ts`) — Fastify plugin with token-auth middleware; all `POST`/`GET`/`DELETE /v1/sessions[/:id[/:action]]` routes mapped; request IDs threaded through envelope responses.
- **Resource measurement** (`src/measurement/`) — `ProcessSampler` polls Node and browser process trees at a configurable interval via `pidusage`; `MeasurementRunner` drives a full launch → navigate → snapshot → screenshot → extract → close scenario and records per-step timings and profile directory sizes; `writeArtifacts` writes `summary.json`, `samples.jsonl`, and `scenario.json` to `.feather/measurements/<runId>/`.

## Test Coverage

| Suite | Files | Tests | Runner |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| Unit | 17 | 98 | `vitest run` (default config) |
| Integration | 5 | 27 | `vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts` |
| Measurement | 1 | 4 | `vitest run --config vitest.measurement.config.ts` |
| **Total** | **23** | **129** | — |

Unit tests cover: config loading, filesystem path helpers, browser mode builder, profile lock, workspace metadata, JSONL logger, credential redaction, `SessionManager`, debug bundle, and all eight command handlers.

Integration tests cover: full API flow (launch → status → navigate → snapshot → extract → screenshot → debug-bundle → close), profile-lock enforcement (409 `PROFILE_LOCKED` on concurrent launch), disposable session cleanup (profile directory removed on close), proxy-redaction (credentials absent from API responses and JSONL log), and HTTP transport (token auth middleware).

Measurement tests exercise the `chromium-headless-shell` scenario end-to-end and assert that `summary.json`, `samples.jsonl`, and `scenario.json` are written with the expected shape.

## Exit Criteria

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| The local service launches and closes a persistent headless Chromium session | ✅ |
| A persistent workspace keeps browser storage across relaunch | ✅ |
| A disposable session runs and cleans up its temporary profile on close | ✅ |
| A concurrent launch against the same persistent profile is rejected with `PROFILE_LOCKED` | ✅ |
| A session launched with proxy configuration reports only redacted proxy metadata in API responses and logs | ✅ |
| The HTTP API completes the full sequence: launch → status → navigate → snapshot → extract → screenshot → debug-bundle → close | ✅ |
| JSONL logs and a debug bundle are written for the session | ✅ |
| Resource measurement artifacts are written for the `chromium-headless-shell` scenario | ✅ |
| The `yt-dlp` adapter remains deferred with a documented boundary in the spec | ✅ |

## Known Tech Debt

### `routes.ts` — `manager as any` handler construction

Four command handlers (`NavigateHandler`, `SnapshotHandler`, `ExtractHandler`, `ScreenshotHandler`) accept a `{ pageId, page }` shape from the manager, but `IManager.getPage()` is typed to return `Page` directly. The route layer works around this with a `manager as any` type cast when constructing those handlers. This is safe at runtime but suppresses type checking on the boundary.

**Resolution path:** update `IManager.getPage()` to return `{ pageId: string; page: Page }`, align the handler constructors to match, and remove the `as any` casts in `routes.ts`.

## Phase 3 Candidates

These items are documented as open questions or deferred boundaries in the Phase 2 spec:

- **`yt-dlp` adapter** — subprocess execution with strict argument construction, per-job output directories, timeout/cancel support, progress parsing, and explicit cookie handoff from a persistent profile export.
- **`chromium-new-headless` measurement comparison** — the verification checklist notes a manual step to run both browser modes and compare `launchMsDiff` in `summary.json`; this could be automated as a scheduled measurement job.
- **Branded Chrome/Edge channel compatibility** — Phase 2 limited scope to `chromium-new-headless` and `chromium-headless-shell`; Chrome/Edge channels are the next compatibility check.
- **Additional transport layers** — the spec explicitly kept command handlers transport-agnostic so that stdio JSON-RPC or Unix socket transport can be added without rewriting handlers.
- **Stale lock handling** — Phase 2 reports stale locks but does not silently delete them; Phase 3 could add a recovery command or a `--force-unlock` flag with appropriate safety checks.
- **Multi-session management** — Phase 2 supports multiple concurrent sessions against different workspaces; any session pooling or work-queue policy is deferred.
- **GUI shell** — explicitly out of scope for Phase 2; a minimal control UI is a natural Phase 3 or Phase 4 candidate once the headless core is stable.
