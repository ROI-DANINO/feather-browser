note: "S3 SHIPPED on dev @ ea0b34a (master untouched @ b278409). Stabilization & Linux-Readiness program FUNCTIONALLY CLOSED (S1✅ S2✅ S3✅). Fastify v4->v5 with ZERO source changes (Zod validation, object-form listen, no connection/hostname/getDefaultRoute; probe-proven fastify-sse-v2 compat). Playwright ^1.50->^1.60, bundled Chromium 148 unchanged. Security: npm audit = 5 dev-only Vitest vulns accepted-risk (no forced vitest@4), API surface review intact. 137 unit + 33 integration green under Fastify 5.8.5 + Playwright 1.60.0, typecheck clean. blog/0005 published. DEFERRED (not blockers): FEATHER_CHROMIUM_PATH (sudo-gated), DebugCapture/trace observability. PARKED: rnd graduation."
